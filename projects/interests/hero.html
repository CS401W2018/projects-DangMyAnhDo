        <p>Nguyen Thi Anh Vien is an extremely talented and respected swimmer. She is not only the pride of Vietnamese sports but also an example of perseverance and tireless effort. Every time I see her compete, I clearly feel her determination and desire to win in every swim, she did not stop rising, overcome all difficult challenges to achiece goals and success, which made me admire and be proud of her. She not only inspires sports but also helps me to learn about persistence and determination in life, no matter how difficult if we are determined to try, we will do it! Since then, I feel more confident in facing my own challenge, whether ar work, study or the problems of life.</p>
