        <h2><em>The Medium (2021)</em> </h2>
        <p>This Thai horror film is about a shamanic ritual gone wrong. It is a combination of traditional and modern horror in the interview style, telling the story of a woman chosen as the medidum for a local spirit. It was so creepy, especially when the shaman's ritual started going horribly wrong and the atmosphere in the movie is extremely tense and scary. My sister could not stand it and sometimes had to hide behind me because of being so scared of scences but it was such a fun experience!</p>
        <h2><em>The Smile 2 (2024)</em></h2>
        <p>The film tells the phenomenon of strange and scary phenomenon that begins when the main character in the movie, she constantly saw a strange smile on everyone's face. The creepy smiles were just so unsettling, and it really got under our skin. I watched with my friends even though we were scared, we still could not stop watching. The tension has followed us until the movie ends.</p>
        <h2><em>Death Whisperer 2 (2024)</em></h2>
        <p>This film starts from a young woman who is able to communicate with the dead and face the dark forces in the past. It was really intense, I love how it mixed ghosts and mystery and there were so many twists. It was a perfect movie night filled with laughs, screams, and lots of fun! </p>
