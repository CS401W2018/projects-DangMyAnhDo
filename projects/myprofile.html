    <h2>Hello, My name is Anh</h2>
    <p>I come from Dong Thap, a small peaceful countryside in the south of Vietnam. I grew up in a close-knit family and we always tried to support each other. I was very lucky to be born into my family, we always share everything together, our joys, difficulties and things we want to do. My parents taught us the importance of gratitude, helping others, and always working hard in everything we do. When I was 18 years old I was introduced to the church by my sister and have been a member of the church for 4 years. </p>
    <p>When I was 22 years old, I received what I consider a miracle in my life that I was able to study at my dream school. I have always loved experiencing new things and I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to study at BYU - Hawaii. It was a great thing, I learned so many different things both <strong>academically and personally</strong>. I hope to return to Vietnam to contribute in some way to the country's development, especially by <em>helping</em> people who are in difficulty.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I love watching movies, exploring new places and playing badminton. These things help me relax and also help me learn many good things from the activities around me. I enjoy exploring new places, whether it's a quiet place or a new city place, it helps me clear my mind and gives the feeling of renewal in the surrounding air. Besides, <span title="Important Activity">badminton</span> is always my favorite sport so I can play with my friends every week! </p>
