    <h2>Questions:</h2>
    <p>What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?</p>
    <p> I put my vids on YouTube cuz its free and everyone can watch, but hate those annoying ads and the fact they can just take my stuff down whenever.</p>
    <p>What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?</p>
    <p> I use transform to make buttons bigger when u hover - looks dope and its easy with just a few lines of code.</p>
    <p>How do you stay safe online?</p>
    <p> I always use 2FA now and strong passwords, plus i never click random links - learned that the hard way.</p>
    <p>What is the schedule for the rest of the class?</p>
    <p>We doing audio/video today, then animations tomorrow, and friday we putting it all together in a project </p>
