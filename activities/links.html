        <h2>Question 1: Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</h2>
        <p>I linked it already</p>
        <h2>Question 2: Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h2>
        <p>Abcolute Link: other domains and the path to the resource, start with "https://....", this link always points to the same resource, no matter where the link is used on the web</p>
        <p>Relative Link: within your own domains, not technically required, this link works based on where the file is located on the website, should use this</p>
        <h2>Question 3: Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder)</h2>
        <p>I also linked to my assignment is structuraltags</p>
        <h2>Question 4: List the 3 rules with relative links.</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Same folder: the file is in the same folder as our page, just use the same file name.</li>
            <li>Subfolder: the file is in a folder inside our current folder, include the folder name.</li>
            <li>Go Up a folder: the file is in a folder above our current one, use <kbd>../</kbd>to go up to one level.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Question 5: Link to your last project.</h2>
        <p>I linked it already </p>
        <h2>Question 6: Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h2>
        <p>No, links don't need to inside a NAV tag. Because links can go anywhere on the page and the NAV tag helps organize them.</p>
