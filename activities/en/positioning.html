        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>1. What is normal flow in HTML?</p>
        <p>Elements stack from top to bottom by default.</p>
        <p>2. What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</p>
        <p>It moves an element left or right, so things can wrap around it. We need to clear the float because clearing the float makes sure the container wraps around the floated element.</p>
        <p>3. What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</p>
        <p>Absolute: positions an element based on its parent or the page. </p>
        <p>Fixed: keeps the element in the same spot when we scroll.</p>
        <p>Relative: moves an element from its original position</p>
        <p>4. How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</p>
        <p>Make buttons big, spaced well, and easy to tap.</p>
        <p>5. Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</p>
        <p>We can find videos in Lecture Notes on Canvas and Youtube.</p>
